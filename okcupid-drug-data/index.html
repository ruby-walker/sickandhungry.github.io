                <h3>Religion</h3>
                <p>As expected, religion has a large impact on whether or not a user will use drugs. People who use drugs are much more likely to identify as agnostic or atheist. Surprisingly, however, people who use drugs "often" are more likely to belong to organized religions than those who use drugs "sometimes."</p>

People who use drugs "sometimes" are the most likely to work in the tech industry. Using drugs "often" makes you more likely to be a student, unemployed, or - more interestingly - retired.</p>

                   <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
                   <span style="text-align: right">
               <p class="statement">	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For years, I have been interested in debunking commonly held stereotypes of drug users. Users and addicts are commonly portrayed as lazy, unemployed heathens that leach resources out of the economy. While much of this stigma has diminished with modern legalization movements, certain drugs and populations (poor people and people of color) continue to be vilified.</p>
	<p class="statement"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The data for these charts was scraped off of OkCupid, the fourth largest dating website in the world, by researchers for the Journal of Statistics Education. I have been following OkCupid’s own data blog for years, as they have a long history of using their data to confront social issues such as racism in the dating scene. The blog recognizes that while many people lie on their dating profiles, this data is still capable of generating many legitimate insights. Dating websites are actually one of the few places online where a significant amount of people will openly admit to using drugs, because drug habits are often an important criteria when searching for partners (i.e. people who use drugs tend to date other people that use drugs).</p>
	 <p class="statement"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of my main goals in designing this website was to keep it engaging for a diverse population of viewers. This is why I chose to display my data using the JavaScript Google Charts API - it allowed me to create charts that are both beautiful and interactive. Using customization tools to replace the keys with rollover labels cleaned up the page and made it easier for users to instantly associate colors with labels; this was especially important considering there are so many different charts that each have different labels. I chose to structure the charts in horizontal columns rather than rows because it allows users to instantly compare the charts without scrolling. This was my first time using an API, and while it took some time to set up, it ultimately proved to be the best option for my purposes.</p>
	<p class="statement"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first thing to notice about these charts is that, regardless of any differences or trends between the three categories, each chart contains users from every possible demographic - there was not a single option that zero users chose. This goes to show that there is no one type of drug user; users come from all socioeconomic demographics and all walks of life.</p>
	<p class="statement"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was no surprise to me. In my personal experience, I’ve met people addicted to hard drugs that work as lawyers, chemists, professors, software developers, and engineers. These people, typically white and upper middle class, often approach drugs with an “it couldn’t possibly happen to me” attitude. Perhaps if we stopped portraying addiction as a problem that only affects poor people of color, these people wouldn’t feel so invincible. Furthermore, perhaps we as a nation would stop treating addiction as a criminal issue and work harder to provide addicts with the recovery resources they need. </p>
	<p class="statement"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The “sometimes” data presents another important point - many people occasionally use (as opposed to “abuse”) drugs with the practice having little to no impact on their day to day life. In every variable, the demographics of people who use drugs “sometimes” had a barely noticable difference between those that “never” use drugs. These people attend work, school, and worship services just like everybody else. They seek love, in all its forms, just like everybody else. However, current laws force these users into the shadows.</p>
  <p class="statement"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Despite their abilities, people that use drugs are often denied jobs due to unnecessary drug tests, creating a substantial negative impact on themselves, their families, and the larger economy. One can only expect that if fear (both the fear of others finding out about one’s drug use and the media- and employer-induced fear of using drugs in the first place) was not an issue, the number of drug users working “professional” jobs would be much higher.</p>
	<p class="statement" style="margin-bottom: 30px">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Industry data aside, this project revealed a variety of other interesting insights that are noted below each of the section headings. My hope is that this work will spur conversations on the issues I’ve brought up as well as other issues I’ve yet to consider.
