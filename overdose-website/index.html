		<h2>Lethal Drug Combinations in Allegheny County</h2>
    <h5>One of the most common misconceptions about the overdose epidemic is the assumption that people are overdosing by taking just one drug. In reality, just 89 of Allegheny County's 738 lethal overdoses - 12 percent - were attributed to a single substance. Many of these deaths could have been prevented with harm reduction education or regulations designed to eliminate undisclosed cutting agents.</h5>
    <h5>In just one year, more than 50 unique substances - overwhelmingly perscription drugs - contributed to overdose deaths in the county. These drugs include...</h5>

      <h5>This project explores five of the most deadly drugs in the county - alcohol, cocaine, alprazolam (xanax), heroin, and fentanyl - to see which other drugs to those deaths. We've created a series of visualizations to examine three major questions: How many drugs were combined? Which drugs were combined? When were they combined?</h5>

    <h5>As a group, we quickly agreed that we wanted to choose a topic centered around Pittsburgh. I suggested a <a href=”https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-fatal-accidental-overdoses/resource/386ca0ed-717d-46d3-8ed2-da37553ec6d1”>dataset</a> from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center website that lists out all the fatal drug overdoses in Allegheny County. This dataset contained data for all 424 closed cases of 2016 drug overdoses. Each case included the date, time, drugs used, age of the user, sex of the user, and zip code of the user as well as zip code of the death.</h5>
    <h5>Because there was so much data, we spent a long time deciding exactly what we wanted to visualize. While we were trying to figure out what to do, Cindy asked why there were multiple drugs listed next to the same person. The rest of the group members admitted they were also confused. I explained to them that most people overdose by taking a combination they don’t usually take, or taking drugs secretly tainted with other drugs. This confusion was what led me to focus in on combinations. </h5>
    <h5>The first thing I did for the project was edit my Python script from Synthesis 2 to calculate things for this project. I created two different programs: <a href=”https://github.com/sickandhungry/overdose-data/blob/master/od_counter.py”>od_counter.py</a> to count the number of drugs combined for overdoses in each of the five major categories (alcohol, cocaine, xanax, heroin, and fentanyl) and <a href=”https://github.com/sickandhungry/overdose-data/blob/master/combo_counter.py”>combo_counter.py</a> to count the number of times any given drug was used in an overdose.</h5>
    <h5>The next thing I did was design the website. We worked as a group to write up some introduction text, draw up a mockup of what we wanted the website to look like, choose colors for the graphs and the website, and decide where we wanted each graph to go. We decided that creating buttons for each of the five major drugs would be a good source of interactivity. </h5>
    <h5>Again, I leveraged resources from my old projects as a backbone for the new website. I also used a button rollover effect that I found at the beginning of the semester on Github, but never had the opportunity to use until now. Lastly, after trying out all the normal websafe fonts and not getting the result I wanted, I looked into other options and found the <a href=”https://fonts.google.com/”>Google Fonts API</a>. I found a cool font called <a href=”https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Stardos+Stencil”>Stardos Stencil</a> and put it in the CSS for body, so it would automatically appear in every section of the website.</h5>
    <h5>The hardest part of this project for me was creating the actual pie chart. I originally wanted to somehow showcase the drugs that went into each individual case, but couldn’t think of any chart that would do that. I began trying to make a simple pie chart in Matplotlib, but couldn’t figure out how to upload CSV data files to the Python code. Since all of my other datasets were so small, I didn’t know how to interact with such a large dataset. </h5>
    <h5>I asked my group members for help, and they suggested trying <a href=”https://plot.ly/”>Plot.ly</a>. This proved to work much better for our purposes, and I was able to quickly create each of the graphs and paste the code into our website.</h5>
    <h5>I was really happy with how we communicated and worked together as a team. Group projects are usually something I fear, but everything about this project went smoothly. I feel like each of us contributed to the best of our abilities and brought something unique to the table, and this led to a final project that each of us can be proud of.</h5>
