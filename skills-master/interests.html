			<p>Like I said in my <a href="index.html">Reflection</a>, one of my main motivations in taking this course was to “learn how to make cool stuff.” Because of this, I’ve decided that I want my first project to be lighthearted and fun. I initially wanted to a project based on scripts from my favorite show, Steven Universe, but later decided that 129 scripts averaging 1800 words each would be a little too much to fish through. I couldn’t decide what to make, so I decided to choose a new topic. </p>
			<p>One day, when I was listening to my favorite artist Chance the Rapper for hours on end, I decided I want to do a project based on his music. One of my favorite things about his albums is that the themes have changed tremendously over time. His earliest albums described typical high school fears - fitting in, looking cool, etc. His next album, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/chancetherapper/sets/chance-the-rapper-10day">10 Day</a>, was written during a 10 day suspension which ended in dropping out of school. This included lyrics like, “Fun fact: I'm never going back to school. Been there, done that.” Four years after 10 Day, he released <a href="https://soundcloud.com/chancetherapper/sets/coloring-book">Coloring Book</a>, which focuses on his sobriety, return to religion, and experiences with fatherhood. Lots of fans were confused, disappointed, and angry about the change. You can learn about about my ideas for this project on the <a href="goals.html">Goals</a> page.</p>
			<p>For my next project, I would like to create something a little more serious. As a Social Work major, there are a whole lot of issues I’m passionate. Unfortunately, most of these issues are very hard to track and do not have solid data. For example, I wanted to do a project on hate crimes against trans people, but quickly realized that any data I could find on that topic would be grossly underreported and inaccurate. I also considered doing a project on the gentrification of East Liberty, especially after finding a cool API for Google Maps, but decided against this because so many people are working on similar projects. </p>
			<p>Right now, I’m still not sure what I want to do for my second project. I am going in for a job interview at the Pittsburgh Department of Human Services Office of LGBT Programming later this week, so I am hoping I will be inspired by something I learn at the interview. Another topic I am considering is self-esteem issues in black girls - this would be a great project to showcase on my Hackathon website, <a href= "https://devpost.com/software/glass-ceiling-lm1vdb">GlassCeiling</a>.</p>
