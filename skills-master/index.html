			<p>For years, I've been surrounded by programmers. My older brother fixes hardware for a living. The first guy I ever dated won awards for being the best programmer in my high school. My next boyfriend founded a nonprofit dedicated to spreading free encryption technologies. My roommate works in tech support, and my best friend is about to start a game design internship. My current partner is sysadmin turned devops engineer that dropped out of college to work at a startup in Silicon Valley.</p>
			<p>...and then there's me.</p>
			<p>Before starting this course, the only experience I had with code was looking at other people's’ terminals and wondering, “what’s that?” I was terrified of math and even more terrified of programming. My partner had tried to teach me Python a few months ago, but I quit and slammed the laptop shut after about thirty minutes. Most of all, I was terrified of failure.</p>
			<p>As soon as I read the description for this course, I dropped the Grant Writing class I had scheduled for the same time and signed up for this. I told all of my friends and posted a status about it. I was really, really excited to code cool stuff.</p>
			<p>As time went on, my friends were my number one source of motivation and support. Just an hour ago, I messaged somebody the link to my GitHub pages site and said, “just added a SWEET custom cursor.” I’ve been sending people links to working projects as well as screenshots of silly mistakes. My friends have helped me fix issues and suggested cool things I might be interested in.</p>
			<p>Despite this collaboration, I’ve still done the majority of my work alone. I realized early on that if I wanted to get anything done, I would have to eliminate all distractions. This meant taking away the snacks, deleting the facebook tab, and shutting out all the noise. </p>
			<p>Besides asking friends for help, almost all of my learning was in Codecademy. This was a good learning environment, but there was a bit of trouble transitioning those skills to real life. For example, Codecademy teaches you all the commands for GitHub, but doesn’t explain how to set it up and log in on your terminal. It teaches you code websites, but doesn’t explain how to save the HTML files and get them up and running. For skills like these, I relied on asking friends to help me set things up.</p>
			<p>My favorite places to work are the computer labs in David Lawrence Hall and the Cathedral ground floor. This is the perfect environment for shutting everything out and getting things done. However, during nights and weekends I am forced to work at home. This means my favorite snacks, a comfy bed, and hundreds of video games are all within arm’s reach. It also means a lot of distractions from my partner, since we share a computer and a life. In order to succeed in this course, I had to learn how to say no of all of that and yes to science. Or, rather, how to compromise - as I write this, I am in my bed, eating pretzels, with my partner laying beside me playing Melee.</p>
			<p>If I could change things, I would have had better time management. I would have scheduled these twenty hours out ahead of time instead of just assuming I’d get everything done. I would have better read the syllabus to find out exactly what I had to learn ahead of time, rather than just looking at it each time I finished something..</p>
			<p>I also would have spent more time learning new skills than practicing and perfecting the ones I’ve already learned. I spent so many hours working on the content of my projects when I should have been focused on learning. This became obvious to me after reading The Role of Deliberate Practice on Expert Preformance. I was engaging in “fun practice” rather than deliberate practice. I was learning along the way, but I wasn’t really pushing myself to learn any major new skills.</p>
			<p>All in all, I’ve already learned more in this course than any other course I’ve ever taken at Pitt. I’ve picked up most of these basic skills a lot more easily than expected, but that doesn’t mean I haven’t been working hard. I’m really proud of how far I’ve come, and excited about the rest of the course! I can’t wait to transfer these web design skills from making simple sites to actual data visualization.</p>
