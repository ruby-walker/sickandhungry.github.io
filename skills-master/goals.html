    <h2 class="log">Goals and Workplan</h2>
        <div class="container">
        	<div class="textbox">
			<p>For my first project, I would like to make something like the college graduation speech analyzer you showed in class to analyze and compare Chance the Rapper’s lyrics over time. I would like to include links to the songs, or even embed SoundCloud players directly on the site. I also think it would be really cool to implement the <a href="https://genius.com/developers">Genius API</a>, which analyzes and explains lyrics line by line.</p>
			<p>This would be a fun project, but it would also showcase many skills that could easily be used in more serious work. I’m not sure how hard it would be to integrate that API, but if I pulled that off it would be really cool. Learning how to do that would all be work outside of class on my own.</p>
			<p>Getting this project done would rely heavily on checking out the code for the original college graduation speech analyzer and other projects like it. I can’t remember what it’s called so I’ll start by asking you for the link. I would probably write this project in Python or Javascript.</p>
			<p>I haven’t decided on a topic for my second project, but I really like the idea of creating a long infographic with lots of different simple interactive charts. I’ve designed several <a href=”http://angelicawalker123.wixsite.com/avw7/graphics”>static infographics</a> in the past, but have never made anything that viewers can actually interact with. Also, having many different charts would make up for the fact that some of the data may be incomplete.</p>

		<h2>Work Plan</h2>
			<ul class="workplan">
				<li class="workplan"><b>Week of January 31: </b> Read code for college speech analyzer and similar projects. Begin to finalize ideas for project. Download/create database of songs. Design website template.</li>
				<li class="workplan"><b>Week of Februrary 7: </b> Create analyzer, maybe using Python skills. Pick out major trends.</li>
				<li class="workplan"><b>Week of Februrary 14: </b> Integrate Genius API and embed Youtube/Soundcloud players. Write artist statement. Finalize ideas for next project.</li>
				<li class="workplan"><b>Week of Februrary 21: </b> Turn in project #1! Gather data for project #2. Design website template. Research cool interactive infographics for inspiration.</li>
				<li class="workplan"><b>Week of Februrary 28: </b> Create first half of charts for infographics.</li>
				<li class="workplan"><b>Week of March 7: </b> Spring Break. Catch up if needed. Study Dataviz, maybe use this for project.</li>
				<li class="workplan"><b>Week of March 14: </b> Create second half of charts. </li>
				<li class="workplan"><b>Week of March 21: </b> Turn in project #2! Begin group work.</li>
