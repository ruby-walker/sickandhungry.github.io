                <p>I am really proud of synthesis two, <i><a href="https://sickandhungry.github.io/chano-meter-website/">The Evolution of Chance</a></i>, as a whole. I like how I was able to use the data and other elements to tell a story. Even the background image, which I manipulated in Paint to fit the site, contributed to the “evolution” theme.</p>
                <p>I actually knew I wanted to do a project on Chance before the first day of class. As soon as I read the examples in the course description, I knew this was something I could be excited about making. However, I quickly realized that my original idea - a website where users could type in words and print out the lyrics themselves - would be way too big of a project for somebody with no programming experience. </p>
                <p>I had to pivot my project to something that was actually doable. What I lost in fancy code, I made up for in the stories I wrote to accompany my visualizations. Writing the album summaries I included was definitely not necessary, but I really enjoyed writing them. They allowed me to reflect not only on the data I compiled, but also on what the music means to me - and it means a lot.</p>
                <p>The lesson I learned from this project was that data is worthless if you can’t convey the meaning of it or why it matters. You might not always need to write hundreds of words about this, but it is extremely important to include in some way, shape, or form. Without this, your visualization means nothing. In my future work, I want to make sure everything I do means something important.<p>
