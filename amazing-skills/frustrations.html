                <p>One of my biggest obstacles came with team based project, <i><a href=”https://sickandhungry.github.io/overdose-website/”>Cocktails That Kill</a></i>. From the beginning, there was an overwhelming amount of data. The original csv file contained over ten columns, so I was unsure of which data I wanted to include and which would be left out. I wanted to create a visualization that showed exactly which combinations people were overdosing on - for example, heroin, fentanyl, klonopin, and methamphetamine - but this proved to be a much larger project that we had time for. Instead, we decided to focus on combinations between two different drugs.</p>
                <p>My next challenge was creating the actual chart in Matplotlib. Because my synthesis projects contained a managable amount of data, I created their charts by typing the data directly into the Python code. With the group project, there was way too much data to do that. I spent hours trying to figure out how to load a csv file into Matplotlib to no avail. </p>
                <p>Finally, when I met up with my group members, we decided to use Plot.ly instead. This turned out to be a great solution, even though I felt like it was “taking the easy way out.” This experience taught me that sometimes it is best to do what is easiest - if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Even though I didn’t get to write as much actual code as I wanted to, I was really happy with how the final project turned out.</p>
