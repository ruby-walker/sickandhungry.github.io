                <p>In both of my synthesis projects, I had the challenge of working with an abnormal amount of variables. In synthesis two, <i><a href="https://sickandhungry.github.io/chano-meter-website/" target="_blank">The Evolution of Chance</a></i>, I was comparing albums as well as songs within albums. My main goal with this project was to compare albums to see how the music has changed over time. </p>
                <p>However, doing just this wouldn’t be telling the whole story. Especially because there were some songs where certain words were repeated over and over in the chorus - like “That’s Love”, which contains 25 out 43 appearances of the word “love” on <i>Acid Rap</i> - it was important to show counts for each individual songs. I really liked some of the other time-based linear visualizations that I saw online, so I chose to go with that. One revision that might make the data even more engaging would be basing it on the actual time it appeared in the song, but this would be a much more time consuming process.</p>
