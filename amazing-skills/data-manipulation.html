          <p>For synthesis two, <i><a href="https://sickandhungry.github.io/chano-meter-website/">The Evolution of Chance</a></i>, I created text documents for every Chance the Rapper song and built a Python program,<i> <a href="https://github.com/sickandhungry/chano-meter/blob/master/chano-meter.py"> The Chano-Meter</a></i>, to automatically count the number of occurances of any given word in every song and album. Manipulating this huge dataset - 41 songs with about 300 words each, approximately 12,300 words total - made something completely incomprehensible easy to understand with a simple look. Furthermore, my program collected data on entire albums as well as individual songs. </p>
          <p>While this program gathered a lot of information, there was a decent amount of data lost in the process. Especially considering Chance is a hip hop artist, every song contained a myriad of synonyms, slang words, double entendres, and other types of wordplay that were unable to be picked up by my simple one-word search process. I did create some theme sets to group similar words together to combat this; for example, I created one chart visualizing all the occurances of the words “killed”, “murdered”, “death”, “died”, “shot”, or “shooting” and one for the words “God”, “Lord”, and “Jesus”.<p>
          <p> However, creating theme categories was only a partial fix. The lack of complete themes became an especially big problem when I wanted to create a chart for words referring to drugs - I quickly realized that there were just too many types of drugs and different street names to count them all. With more resources, I would have used an established database of word categories to guide the project.</p>
