                <p>At the beginning of this class, I was terrified of code. More specifically, I was terrified of failure. Even though I’ve been interesting in programming since before I even started high school, I spent years avoiding it because I was convinced that I wasn’t smart enough or good enough to succeed.</p>
                <p>This reminds me of a quote from one of Chance’s earlier mixtapes, even before Ten Day:</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 30px">It stings when you have in your head the idea, the thought that you're inferior, that your music or whatever you put your heart into is not good enough. We revolt against that thought... We want not only to free ourselves of that thought, but to let everyone out there who has ever heard that know you're not just good enough, <i>you are simply amazing</i>. So I want everybody, who's ever had that thought to find whatever person, whatever group, society, or person over you. I want you to grab that person and ask them, look into their eyes and ask them <i>"Am I good enough now?"</i></p>
                <p>Now, I feel like I am good enough. I’m planning on attending <a href="https://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a> in San Francisco after graduation, and going into a career in web development. </p>
                <p>This website is a reflection on my first four months of web design. Click the headers on top of the page to navigate the site.</p>
